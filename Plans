Our Idea
	Our plan is to create an automatic filling character sheet that will semi-automate the process of creating characters, and we plan on using the Java framework Spring MVC to integrate this sheet into an online website application.

Our Plan
	We plan on using several different classes in order to make the project function.
We could have people use a code word and be able to save their characters
